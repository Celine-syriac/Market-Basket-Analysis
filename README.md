## Association Rules Generation and Cross-Country Analysis

### Overview
This repository documents an unsupervised machine learning algorithm developed for producing association rules using the APRIORI algorithm for affinity analysis. The project involved processing and analyzing an extensive dataset of nearly 500,000 records, resulting in valuable insights that contributed to data-driven decision-making and improved business strategies. The analysis had a specific focus on datasets from France and Australia, allowing for a deeper understanding of market dynamics and customer behaviors in these regions.
